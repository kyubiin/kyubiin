# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a passionate AI researcher and developer interested in **deep learning**, **vision–language models**, and **NLP applications**.  
I enjoy researching and developing systems in these fields—from training neural networks to deploying real-world applications—especially those that combine perception and language understanding.

## 📌 Experiences

### Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Intelligent Interaction Center  
**Dec. 2024 – Jun. 2025**  
- Trained **custom wake word detection models** and converted them to ONNX format.  
- Successfully embedded the ONNX wake word system into an **Android real-time inference app**.  
- Developed and quantized YOLO-based ensemble models for vision tasks, then embedded them into Android apps.  
- Worked on Human Detection, Face Recognition, Emotion Recognition, Action Recognition, and Gaze Estimation.  
- Built and deployed a RAG system using Triton Inference Server, Llama 3, Milvus, and Redis.

### Korea University, Language & Intelligence Laboratory  
**Mar. 2025 – Present**  
- Researching hallucination mitigation in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) via contrastive decoding and RAG.

### Data Science Student Association, INSIGHT (Sogang University)  
**Mar. 2024 – Feb. 2025**  
- Served as a core member and project lead.  
  - **LG Aimers / Data Intelligence Internship** (Jul. 2024 – Aug. 2024): Developed data pipelines and exploratory analyses for real-world AI use cases.

### Like Lion (멋쟁이사자처럼) at Sogang University  
**Mar. 2023 – Dec. 2024**  
- Backend developer for **Silver Campus**, an internet-lecture platform for seniors.  
  - Repository: [SilverCampus/aws_server](https://github.com/SilverCampus/aws_server)

### Seoul Institute of Technology, Residential Environment Research Lab  
**Jan. 2023 – Mar. 2023**  
- Established low-carbon building management guidelines based on building carbon-emission analysis.

### ENACTUS at Sogang University  
**Mar. 2020 – Dec. 2020**  
- Participated in **Kakao Impact X MYSC 100UP Problem-Definition Workshop** (Jul. 2020 – Aug. 2020).  
- Helped secure a ₩40 million grant for a collaborative clothing-manufacturer support program.
